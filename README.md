Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Classification
This project involves building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/PyTorch for image classification. The model was trained on a labeled dataset, optimized using techniques like dropout and batch normalization, and evaluated on a test dataset. Key metrics such as accuracy and loss were used to assess performance, providing insights into the model's effectiveness in image recognition tasks.
